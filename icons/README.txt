Notes:

1. “davinci4.xcf” and “davinci4.jpg” was the original design of the icon.
2. The icon vector graph was created in VectorDesigner, “omnidroid.vdesigner“ is the source file.
3. “omnidroid_icon.png“ is exported from the original vector graph.
4. “omnidroid_launch.png” is the launch icon shows on the screen, “ominidroid_launch_large” is a bigger version of that.
