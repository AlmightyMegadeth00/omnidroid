                            OmniDroid - Bugs

UI:
* Deleting one OmniHandler sometimes removes them all
* Flipping the phone closed on the filter/data pages erases any currently
added filters

ENGINE:
* Last entry in CP is sent pulled from event data instead of current entry

Broadcast Receiver Service:
* The Broadcast Receiver Service restarts randomly. Perhaps need to research the OnBind method of the Service.

URI passing:
* Unable to pass URI in the data field of the intent. Currently using extras to pass URIs.

OmniDroid Content Provider:
* Need to retain the Content Provider data on Application Re-installation.
