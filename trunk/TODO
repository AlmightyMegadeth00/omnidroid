                              OmniDroid - TODO

ENGINE:
  Off-By-One Data Error Solution:
    1) Have a separate "SMS plug in" which understands our framework.
    2) This plug in will generate EVENTS as required to interact with
       OmniDroid.(ie Event containing the URI pointing to the exact record). At
       the moment we do not get the exact URI from the SMS application; so we
       query the last record in the CP. This causes the "off by one" bug.
       Our suggested SMS plugin will have a "CONTENT PROVIDER OBSERVER" with
       generates OmniDroid events only when the SMS CP is updated with the
       required record.
    3) These plug ins could be provided for all important applications; till
       they interact in the way we would like them to. ie. Once applications
       adapt to our framework we can get rid of the plugins.
    4) These plug ins could have their own CP if there is no CP for the
       original application.

UI:
  Feature request: Edit OmniHandler
  Feature request: Edit Filter
  Feature request: Edit Action
  Feature request: Allow multiple filters
  Feature request: Allow multiple actions
  
Third Party Applications:
    To join the OmniDroid pool of applications, third party applications need
    to provide their application configuration file in their APP_COFIG_SPACE.
    OmniDroid functionality: Need to provide functionality in OmniDroid to parse
    the APP_CONFIG_SPACE of all applications on the phone and add their configuration
    to the OMNIDORID application configuration file; to enable OmniDroid to understand 
    their behavior.
