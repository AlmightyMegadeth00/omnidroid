I. GETTING OMNIDROID

    Requirements:
        * Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk)
        * Subversion

    Download the source:
        Download the source code from our Subversion repository
        (https://subversive.cims.nyu.edu/itp/sp09-google/trunk)



II. BUILDING/RUNNING OMNIDROID

    OmniDroid is currently only available in source form for development.  To
    use OmniDroid in developing your application, you will need to check the
    source out of the source repository (see "GETTING OMNIDROID") and build
    the apk file.  Once you have the apk file, you can add it to your
    development device or emulator.

    Building from inside Eclipse:
        1) Install the ADT Plugin for Eclipse (see 
           http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r1/installing.html#installingplugin)
        2) Set the path to the Android SDK in the Eclipse prefencense
           configuration.
        3) Create a new Android project from already excisting source (use the
           trunk folder you checked out from the repository)
        4) Compile and run using the android SDK tools (see
           http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html#Running
           for instructions)

    For other IDE's or commandline usage, refer to the android website for
    documentaiton specifically these two pages:
        http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html
        http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html
