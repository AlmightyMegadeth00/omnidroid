This page shows some ISSUE we try to solve but failed.

==Monitor Email/Calendar==

=Idea=
Try to monitor the email, so when a new email comes, we can sent out intent to our broadcastReceiver.

=Problems=
The build-in Email or Gmail or Calendar apps are not sending intent to public. We can't find an effective way to monitor the email or calendar. We could write our own monitor to poll server, but that drains the battery.

=Next step=
Do more research. Maybe find a 3rd party application that do send intent, or contact Gmail/Calendar dev team.
