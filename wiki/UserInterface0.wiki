#summary Sketch of possible UI

= Introduction =

This is just a sample UI we could implement for Omnidroid. An intro splash screen has not been created - this would probably include:
  * View saved rules
  * Create new rule
  * Help
  * About

These sketches start from the context of creating a new rule. Some pros and cons listed at the end.
<br /><br />
We should also investigate a UI made of pure Android components, as an alternate to one made with custom drawing code.
