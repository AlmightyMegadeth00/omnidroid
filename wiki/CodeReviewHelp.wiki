= How to do code review =

== Short Answer ==
1. Download this file: <br/>
http://codereview.appspot.com/static/upload.py (make sure you have python 2.5+ installed, and include it in your path)
<br/><br/>

2. Here is a sample from Michael to send invitations:<br/>
upload.py -r omnidroid-devel@googlegroups.com --send_mail -m "Removed workspace warnings and added svn:ignore values. Fixes issue #4." 
<br/><br/>

3. Reviewers come and mark it up with suggestions.

4. Coder then addresses those comments in the code, runs upload.py again (this time
including -i ##### so it patches an existing code review and doesn't create a new
one), and then address EACH comment in the codereview tool.  Most of them
will probably just be "done" but sometimes the coder might disagree so they'll reply
with my opinion.

5. The reviewers either point out more issues to address, in which case the coder
repeats the patch cycle, or they give the coder the go ahead to submit.  Once the coder has addressed all the reviewers comments and has at least one approval from a reviewer, the coder can do an svn update (in case anything has changed) and then a commit.
