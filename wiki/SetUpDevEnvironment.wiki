== II - How to get omnidroid running in emulator ==
 # Prerequisite
  * Make sure you have Android SDK, Eclipse(with Android plugin) installed.
 # Create a Android Virtual Device (If you already create a 1.5 AVD, skip this step.)
   * In Eclipse: Windows -> Android AVD Manager 
    * Name = Whatever you like
    * Target = Android 1.5 - 1.5
    * Skin = Default
    * Click on "Create AVD"
 # Checking out the Code
  * Manually checkout source codes (If you wanna use subclipse, skip to 3b)
   * Make sure you have SVN command tools installed.<br />
   * Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/omnidroid/source/checkout project site] and checkout the source code.
   * In Eclipse: File -> New -> Other -> Android Project
   * Select "Create project from existing code", with the local svn folder you just checked out.
   * Project name = Whatever you like
   * Build Target = "Android 1.5"
   * Application name = Whatever you like
   * Min SDK Version = 2
  * checkout source code with subclipse (This is not necessary if you use svn command manually)
   * Install [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ subclipse]
   * In Eclipse: Window -> Show View -> other-> SVN Repositories
   * Click on the "+" sign
   * url: http://omnidroid.googlecode.com/svn -> Finish
   * Right click url -> Checkout.... Use the defaults and click Finish.
 # Run the application
  * In Eclipse:
   *  Project -> Build All
   *  Run -> Android Application
  * In Emulator: Launch omnidroid <br />
   * Menu -> Run Tests -> User Config
   * Menu -> Run Tests -> App Config
   * _Notes: This registers applications that we've been working on with OmniDroid. OmniDroid should eventually do this on Install itself._
