== Getting omnidroid to run in emulator ==
=== Prerequisite ===
  * Make sure you have Android SDK, Eclipse(with Android plugin) installed.
=== Create a Android Virtual Device (If you already create a 1.5 AVD, skip this step.) === 
  *  In Eclipse: Windows -> Android AVD Manager <br/>
  *  Name = Whatever you like<br/>
  *  Target = Android 1.5 - 1.5<br/>
  *  Skin = Default<br/>
  *  Click on "Create AVD"<br/>
=== Checking out the Code === 
==== Manually checkout source codes (If you would like to use subclipse, skip to next step.) ====
    * Make sure you have SVN command tools installed.<br />
    * Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/omnidroid/source/checkout project site] and checkout the source code.<br />
    * In Eclipse: File -> New -> Other -> Android Project<br />
    * Select "Create project from existing code", with the local svn folder you just checked out.<br />
      Project name = Whatever you like<br />
      Build Target = "Android 1.5"<br />
      Application name = Whatever you like<br />
      Min SDK Version = 2<br />
==== checkout source code with subclipse (This is not necessary if you use svn command manually) ====
    * Install [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ subclipse]<br />
    * In Eclipse: Window -> Show View -> other-> SVN Repositories<br />
    * Click on the "+" sign<br />
    * url: http://omnidroid.googlecode.com/svn -> Finish<br />
    * Right click url -> Checkout.... Use the defaults and click Finish.<br />
===  Run the application === 
  * In Eclipse:
   *  Project -> Build All
   *  Run -> Android Application
  * In Emulator: Launch omnidroid <br />
   * Menu -> Run Tests -> User Config
   * Menu -> Run Tests -> App Config
   * _Notes: This registers applications that we've been working on with OmniDroid. OmniDroid should eventually do this on Install itself._
