== II - How to get omnidroid running in emulator ==
1. Prerequisite<br/> 
Make sure you have Android SDK, Eclipse(with Android plugin) installed.<br /><br/>

2. Create a Android Virtual Device (If you already create a 1.5 AVD, skip this step.) <br/>
In Eclipse: Windows -> Android AVD Manager 
    Name = Whatever you like
    Target = Android 1.5 - 1.5
    Skin = Default
    Click on "Create AVD"
<br />

3a. Manually checkout source codes (If you wanna use subclipse, skip to 3b)<br />
Make sure you have SVN command tools installed.<br />
Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/omnidroid/source/checkout project site] and checkout the source code.<br />
In Eclipse: File -> New -> Other -> Android Project <br />
    Select "Create project from existing code", with the local svn folder you just checked out.
    Project name = Whatever you like
    Build Target = "Android 1.5"
    Application name = Whatever you like
    Min SDK Version = 2
<br/>

3b. checkout source code with subclipse (This is not necessary if you use svn command manually)<br/>
Install [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ subclipse]<br />
In Eclipse: Window -> Show View -> other-> SVN Repositories
    Click on the "+" sign
    url: http://omnidroid.googlecode.com/svn -> Finish
    Right click url -> Checkout.... Use the defaults and click Finish.
<br/>

4. Run the application <br/>
In Eclipse: <br/>
    Project -> Build All
    Run -> Android Application

In Emulator: Launch omnidroid <br />
    Menu -> Run Tests -> User Config
    Menu -> Run Tests -> App Config
Notes: This registers applications that we've been working on with OmniDroid. OmniDroid should eventually do this on Install itself.<br /><br />
