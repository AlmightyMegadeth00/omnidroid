This page shows some ISSUE we try to solve but failed. The purpose of this page is to avoid people new to this project wast time on what we already tried but failed.


=Monitor Email/Calendar==

==Idea==
Try to monitor the email, so when a new email comes, we can sent out intent to our broadcastReceiver.

==Problems==
The build-in Email or Gmail or Calendar apps are not sending intent to public. We can't find an effective way to monitor the email or calendar. We could write our own monitor to poll server, but that drains the battery.

==Next step==
Do more research. Maybe find a 3rd party application that do send intent, or contact Gmail/Calendar dev team.

=Facebook Update Action=

==Idea==
This would allow the user to send updates to facebook based on messages received similar to the twitter update action that we created. Issues faced:

==Problems==
We were working with two libraries

The thing with Facebook libraries is that you cant pass the username/password to some function to login to facebook. You have to enter the username, password via a login page if the session has expired.

This will not work for our Omnidroid as compared to updating status on twitter ( where we pass the username password as parameters to a function to login to twitter).
