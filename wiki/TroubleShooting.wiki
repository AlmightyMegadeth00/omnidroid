== `[`Solved - Issue6`]` Emulator instances cannot see each other ==
I get this error when I am trying to send SMS to (or call) other running emulator: <br />
emulator: could not connect client socket to :::::::00001:5556: Invalid argument.

Workarounds:
Disable IPv6 (use IPv4), or wait for the next release of Android.

See Issue 6 for more information.
